## 3. Design

The following section describes the design and implementation of the product. UML diagrams and code snippets are used
to explain some aspects of the code. If you are unfamiliar with UML, the diagrams should still be fairly
understandable. However, you may wish to consult [[CS2113/T] Modeling](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/modeling.html) for a quick introduction to UML.

### 3.1 Architecture (Neil)

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The following diagram provides a rough overview of how **Zer0Note** is built.

![Architecture Diagram](diagrams/class/jpeg/architecture_neil.jpg)

The `CliUserInteface` (see [here](#32-ui-component-neil)) is the "highest" layer of the application, in
the sense that it interacts directly with the user, and it passes along the input to other classes. The
`CliUserInterface` contains the state of the application, stored in an instance of `AppState`. It then uses the other
classes such as `InputParser` and the various `CliCommand` classes to execute the instructions provided by the user
. This is explained in more detail in the following sections.

### 3.2 UI Component (Neil)

The user interface of **Zer0Note** is provided by the class `CliUserInterface`. It is instantiated once in the main
method, and its `run()` method is called to start the UI for the application.

The class diagram below describes the `CliUserInterface` class, and the classes it depends on.

// TODO: add class diagram for CliUserInterface

The `CliUserInterface` class contains an instance of `AppState`. This is a class that, as the name implies, contains
the current state of the running instance of the application. For example, it contains the user data, the current mode,
the navigation state (i.e. currently chosen notebook/section/page).

The following sequence diagram describes the operation of the `run()` method in `CliUserInterface`.

// TODO: add sequence diagram.

First, the method `loadState()` is called, which loads the save file, and populates the `AppState` object with the
previously saved user data.

Then, the `startUI()` method is called to display the welcome message to the user.

The `CliUserInterface` class then continuously gets the input from the user. It then uses the `InputParser` class to
parse this input and creates a new `CliCommand` object based on the command entered by the user. It executes the
command with `CliCommand.execute()` (learn more [here](#33-commands-component-neil)), which will use or modify the
`AppState` instance to make the requested change.

If any of these steps encounters an error, an exception of the type `ZeroNoteException` is thrown by the method, and
caught in the `run()` method. Upon catching an exception, the `printErrorMessage()` method is called to display the
appropriate error message to the user. See [here]() for more information on how exceptions work in **Zer0Note**.

### 3.3. Commands Component (Neil)

Every command that a user can input into **Zer0Note** is represented by an object that extends the abstract class
`CliCommand`. `CliCommand` contains some basic fields and methods that are shared by all types of commands, such as:

* `execute()`, which is called after setting up the object appropriately, to perform the action requested by the user;

* `appState`, which refers to the `AppState` object that stores the state of the currently running instance of
**Zer0Note**; and

* `commandParams`, which is a String containing the parameters the user entered as parameters to the command.

The following 2 UML diagrams show the different types of `CliCommand` components used in the application.

This diagram describes the `CliCommand`s related to the Timetable mode.

![UML diagram for Timetable Commands](diagrams/class/jpeg/timetable_commands.jpg)

And this diagram describes the `CliCommand`s related to the Notebook mode.

![UML diagrams for Notebook Commands](diagrams/class/jpeg/notebook_commands.jpg)

// TODO: add the new commands for "Find", "Tag", "SortByDate".

### 3.4. Tasks Component

![UML Diagram from Task Component](diagrams/class/jpeg/taskComponent.jpg)

Figure []. Structure of Tasks Component

The `Tasks` component,

- stores an array of `Task` objects that represents the deadline of the user.
- together with the `Notebooks` component form the `AppState` component.   

The `TaskList` class,

- has methods to add a new `Task` object and remove existing one at an index.

### 3.5. Notebooks Component

![UML diagram for Notebooks Component](diagrams/class/jpeg/notebooks_simplified.jpg)

Figure []. Structure of Notebooks Component

The `Notebooks` class,

- stores a `NotebookShelf` object that contains a list of `Notebook` objects.
- together with the `Tasks` component form the `AppState` component.

The `NotebookShelf` class,

- has methods to add new `Notebook` object and remove existing one.
- has methods to search through to find a `Notebook` object with matching titles.

The `Notebook` class,

- contains a title and a list of `Section` objects.
- has methods to add new `Section` object or remove existing one.
- has a `tag` field that user can be set and get.

The `Section` object,

- contains a title and list of `Page` objects.
- has methods to add new `Page` object or remove existing one.
- has a `tag` field that user can be set and get.

The `Page` object,

- contains a title, and the content of the page as a String object.
- has a `tag` field that user can be set and get.

### 3.6. Storage Component

![UML diagram for Storage](diagrams/class/jpeg/Storage_UML_class.jpeg)

The `Storage` component,

* Contains the method `saveToFile` to save the current AppState of the application in the `notebooks.txt` and `tasks.txt` files.  

* Contains the method `readFromFile` to load up data containing the input of the user's previous session on Zer0Note.  

* Saves the name of the user in a `nameOfUser.txt` and reads it back in the form of personalised messages.   

## 4. Implementation

The following section describes the implementation of certain key features in the current version of Zer0Note. It also
provides some background into our (the original developers of Zer0Note) thinking and the rationale behind the
decisions.

### 4.1. Mode Switch Feature

#### 4.1.1. Implementation

The mode switch mechanism is facilitated by `AppState`. It contains an `AppMode` object and can be accessed from
`Mode Switch` object.

The following sequence diagram shows how the mode switch operation works:

![Sequence Diagram for Mode Switch Command](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_ModeSwitch.jpg)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mode switch function behaves.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AppState` object is constructed and the `AppMode`
field is set to `TIMETABLE` by default.

Step 2. The user types `mode /n`. The `mode /t` command is passed through
`InputParser#getCommandFromInput`, which constructs a `ModeSwitch` object and calls `ModeSwitch#execute()`.

Step 3. `execute()` is called, which then set the `AppMode` field in the `AppState` object either to `TIMETABLE`
or `NOTEBOOK_SHELF` or throw an `InvalidCommandException`.

Step 4. To signal that the user has successfully changed the mode, a message is printed with the current mode of the
program.  

#### 4.1.2. Design Considerations

/* work in progress */

### 4.2. Timetable Mode

#### 4.2.1. TaskList Management Feature

##### 4.2.1.1. Implementation

`TaskList` is implemented to manage and store the tasks input by the user. It comprises an `ArrayList` list of
 `Task`s, and a few helper methods.

This means that multiple operations such as addition and deletion can be done on a `Task`, without affecting
the contents of other `Task` in the `TaskList`.
<br>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add task function behaves.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. CliUserInterface#executeCommand is called when the user adds a `Task` into the `TaskList`.

2. The user types `add /tTask /by19-10-2020 1900`. The `add` command is passed through `InputParser#getCommandFromInput`, which then creates a constructor for `AddCommandTimetableMode`.

3. `AddCommandTimetableMode#execute()` is called, which then calls `InputParser#parseTaskTitle`, which first extracts the `title` from the user's input.

4. `InputParser#parseDeadline` is then called, which returns the `deadline` to `AddCommandTimetableMode#execute()`.

5. `TaskList#addTask` is then called and a new `Task`, with `title` and `deadline`, is initialised.

6. To signal that the user has successfully added a task, a message is printed with `CliMessages#printAddedTaskMessage`.

The UML sequence diagram below shows how the add task command works.
![Sequence Diagram for Add Task Command](diagrams/class/jpeg/add_task.jpg)

<hr>
TaskList also allows the deletion of tasks by the user.

The figure below shows how the delete task command works:
![Sequence Diagram for Delete Task Command](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_RemoveTimetable.jpg)

Here are the general steps that the command goes through when the user inputs "delete 1":
1. The `CliUserInterface` receives the "delete 1" input by the user and passes it to the `InputParser` class.
2. `InputParser` parses the input to determine the type of command and the index of the task that is required to delete.
The Parser then constructs a `RemoveCommandTimetableMode` with constructor as shown below.
```java
public RemoveCommandTimetableMode(int indexToRemove, AppState uiMode) {
    this.setAppState(uiMode);
    this.indexToRemove = indexToRemove;
}
```
3. Method **execute()** then calls the `TaskList` stored in `AppState` to update the deletion of the task.
It also constructs `CliMessages` to display messages to the user.
4. If the deletion is successful, `CliMessages` displays the message to the user.

##### 4.2.1.2. Design Considerations

###### Aspect: How to store tasks in `TaskList`
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as an `ArrayList` of tasks
    - Pros: It is easier to implement because the code base are list based.
    - Cons: It is unoptimized in terms of complexity, which requires more work for scaling of the application.
- **Alternative 2:** Store as a Hash Table with the key as the index and value as `Task`
    - Pros: It has a better time complexity and reduce the work in scaling stage since this data structure is more optimized (O(1) can be achieved).
    - Cons: It takes more resources to implement. The constant factor for a hashing algorithm is significant and not
     worth the tradeoff for smaller amounts of data, like a typical user would be likely to generate.

#### 4.2.2. Mark as done feature  

##### 4.2.2.1. Implementation  

The `Task` class contains a member `isDone` of Boolean type.

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark as done operation works:  

// TODO Insert diagram inside 

The following is an example of the processes that occur when the user uses the mark as done function:  

Step 1. The user types `done 1`. The `done 1` command is passed through `InputParser#getCommandFromInput`, which constructs a DoneCommandTimetableMode object and calls `DoneCommandTimetable#execute()`.  

Step 2. `execute()` is called, which then initialises a variable `taskList` of type TaskList. The method then calls `AppState#getTaskList`, which returns all exisiting tasks in the current tasklist.  

Step 3. The `execute()` method proceeds to parse the user's intended task index to be marked as done through `Integer.parseInt()`. Using this index, it initialises a varible `taskDone` of type task and calls `AppState#markAsDone(index)`.  
        
Step 4. After `taskDone` is initialised, a `messages` of type CliMessages calls a method `printMarkDone(taskDone)` with the variable `taskDone` as the argument, which in turn prints a success message with the respective task to the user.   

##### 4.2.2.2. Design Considerations

#### 4.2.3. Tag Feature
The user can tag `Task`s in the `TaskList`. This section describes the implementation and design considerations for this
feature.

##### 4.2.3.1. Implementation
The `Task` class contains a member `tag` of String type.

The figure below shows how the tag operation works:

![Sequence Diagram for Tag Timetable command](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_TagTimetable.jpg)

There are 3 crucial processes during the tag operation. When the user enters `tag 1 /tCS2113T` into the command window while using the application:

**Input Parsing**
1. `CliUserInterface` receives the "tag 1 /tCS2113T" input by the user and calls the `executeCommand` method.
2. Method `executeCommand` constructs the `InputParser` class and calls `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` to pass the
input to `InputParser`.
3. `InputParser#getCommandFromInput`calls `InputParser#parseTagDescription` to separate the index from the tag.
4. If the application is in the timetable mode, `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` then parses the index and constructs
the `TagCommandTimetableMode` class.
5. `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` returns `TagCommandTimetableMode` back to `CliUserInterface`

**Command Execution**
1. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` calls `TagCommandTimetableMode#execute` to execute the command.
2. In `TagCommandTimetableMode#execute()`, the `CliMessages` class, which prints any outputs to the user, is constructed.
3. `Tasklist#getTask` returns the `Task` that is specified by the index.
4. `Task#setTag` changes the `tag` member of `Task` to the tag input by the user.
5. If the tag is successful, `CliMessages#printTagTaskMessage` displays the message to the user.

**Storage**
1. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` finally calls `TagCommandTimetableMode#isTriggerAutoSave` method to check whether a change
has been made.
2. If the method returns `True`, `CliUserInterface#executeCommand`calls `saveState` method to save the
current list.
3. The tag operation ends.

##### 4.2.3.2. Design Considerations
This section describes some of the considerations involved when designing the tag feature.

###### Aspect: How to store the tags
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as a private `String` member in every task
    - Pros: It is easy to access for print operations.
    - Cons: It is unoptimized in terms of complexity for search operations, which requires more work for scaling of the
    application.
- **Alternative 2:** Store as a Hash Table with the key as the tag and value as `Task`
    - Pros: It has a better time complexity for search operations since this data structure is more optimized (O(1) can
    be achieved).
    - Cons: It is hard to retrieve the tag for a specific `Task` due to the structure of the key-value pair.

#### 4.2.4. List Feature

##### 4.2.4.1. Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

![Sequence Diagram for List Urgent](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_ListUrgent.jpg)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list function behaves.

Step 1. The user types `list /urgent`. The `list /urgent` command is passed through
`InputParser#getCommandFromInput`, which constructs a `ListCommandTimetableMode` object and calls
`ListCommandTimetableMode#execute()`.

Step 2. `execute()` is called, which then calls the `sort()` function of `Collections` utility class and sort the list
based on the due date of the `Task` objects in the list.

Step 3. The program prints up to three tasks in the sorted list.

#### 4.2.5. Search Feature
This feature allows the user to search for tasks by keyword or by tag. Refer to
[Tag Feature](#423-tag-feature) for more information on the implementation of tags.

This section explains the implementation and design considerations for the search feature.

##### 4.2.5.1. Implementation

The search feature is mainly executed by a `FindCommandTimetableMode` class. The following sequence diagram shows an
example of how the complete command works:

![Sequence Diagram for Find command](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_FindTimetable.jpg)

There are 3 crucial processes during the search operation. For example, when the user enters `find ` into the command
window while using the application:

**Input Parsing**
1. `CliUserInterface` receives the "find " input by the user and calls the `executeCommand` method.
2. Method `executeCommand` constructs the `InputParser` class and calls `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` to pass the
input to `InputParser`.
3. Method `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` does the following:<br>
    a. Calls `InputParser#parseTagDescription` to identify the keyword or tag. The `keyword` and `tag` are set as empty
    if they are not specified.<br>
    b. Constructs the `FindCommandTimetableMode` class. <br>
    c. Returns `FindCommandTimetableMode` back to `CliUserInterface`. <br>

**Command Execution**
1. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` calls `FindCommandTimetableMode#execute` to execute the command.
2. Method `FindCommandTimetableMode#execute()` does the following:<br>
    a. Constructs `CliMessages` class, which prints any outputs to the user<br>
    b. Obtains the full tasklist `tasks` from `AppState#getTaskList`<br>
    c. If `keyword` is specified (not empty), `getTasksWithTitleContainingKeyword(tasks)` is calle, which returns a
    list of tasks with their titles containing `keyword`.<br>
    d. Else, if the `tag` is specified (not empty), `getTasksWithTagsContainingKeyword(tasks)` is called, which returns
    a list of tasks with their tags matching `tag`. This is the method called in this example.<br>
    e. Calls `CliMessages#printFoundTasksMessage` to display the message to the user.

**Storage**
1. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` calls `FindCommandTimetableMode#isTriggerAutoSave` method to check whether a change
has been made.
2. If the method returns `True`, `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` calls `saveState` method to save the
current list.
3. The find operation ends.

##### 4.2.5.2. Design Considerations

This section describes some considerations involved when designing the find feature.

**Aspect: Distinction between finding by keyword and finding by tag**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Handle as a if-else statement in a single class
- **Alternative 2:** Two different classes that are subclasses to a class `FindCommandTimetableMode`
    - Pros: Higher level of abstraction
    - Cons: Unable to be returned directly by `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` as they are not subclasses of the
    `CliCommand` class. An if-else statement is still required inside the`FindCommandTimetableMode#execute` method.

### 4.3. Notebook Mode

#### 4.3.1. Notebook Management Feature

As shown in Figure 1, the `NotebookShelf` class comprises instances of `Notebook` class. `Notebook` comprises `Section`
and `Section` comprises `Page`. The navigability is not bidirectional. Multiple operations such as addition and deletion
can be done without affecting other instances at all, while updating the `Notebook` it is in.

This section explains the implementation and design considerations for managing `Notebook`s.

##### 4.3.1.1 Implementation
There are two main functions in notebook management: add and remove.
<br>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add notebook function behaves.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` is called when the user adds new `Notebook` into the `NotebookShelf`.

2. The user types `add /nCS2113T`. The `add` command is passed through `InputParser#getCommandFromInput`.

3. `InputParser#parseNotebookTitle` is then called, and it returns the `titleToAdd`, which is `CS2113T`.

4. A constructor for `AddCommandNotebookMode` is created.

5. `AddCommandNotebookMode#execute()` runs, which then calls `NotebookShelf#addNotebook`.

6. A new `Notebook`, entitled `CS2113T` is initialised.

The UML sequence diagram below shows how the add notebook command works.
![Sequence Diagram for Add Notebook Command](diagrams/class/jpeg/add_notebook.jpg)

<hr>
Notebook Mode also allows the user to remove a notebook/section/page.

The figure below shows how the "remove task" command works:
![Sequence Diagram for Delete Task Command](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_RemoveNotebook.jpg)

After calling `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` from `CliUserInterface`:
1. `InputParser` parses the input to return the `notebookTitleToRemove`, `sectionTitleToRemove` and `pageNumberToRemove`.
Some of these members may be empty.
2. `InputParser` constructs and returns the `RemoveCommandNotebookMode` class with constructor as shown below:
```java
public RemoveCommandNotebookMode(String notebookTitle, String sectionTitle,
                                     int pageNumber, AppState appState) {
    this.appState = appState;
    notebookTitleToRemove = notebookTitle;
    sectionTitleToRemove = sectionTitle;
    pageNumberToRemove = pageNumber;

    currentBookshelf = appState.getCurrentBookShelf();
    currentNotebook = appState.getCurrentNotebook();
    currentSection = appState.getCurrentSection();
}
```
3. Method **execute()** is called by `CliUserInterface` to delete a notebook, section, or page, depending on the input.
A switch-case block is used to determine the method to call based on the `appMode`.
4. If the deletion is successful, `CliMessages` displays the message to the user.

#### 4.3.2. Select Feature

The user can `select` a `Notebook`, `Section` or `Page` to view its contents. This section describes the implementation and design considerations for this feature.

##### 4.3.2.1. Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the select notebook function behaves.

1. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` is called when the user selects a `Notebook` from the `NotebookShelf`.

2. The user types `select /nCS2113T`. The `select` command is passed through `InputParser#getCommandFromInput`.

3. `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` returns the command `SelectCommandNotebookMode`.

4. A constructor for `SelectCommandNotebookMode` is created.

5. `SelectCommandNotebookMode#execute()` runs, which then calls `InputParser#extractParams`.

6. If the argument typed by the user contains `/n`, which is the Notebook delimitter, `InputParser#extractNotebookParams` is called.

7. Within `InputParser#extractNotebookParams`, `AppState#setAppMode` is called to set the `AppMode` as `NOTEBOOK_BOOK`.

The UML sequence diagram below shows how the select notebook command works.
![Sequence Diagram for Add Task Command](diagrams/class/jpeg/select_notebook.jpg)

##### 4.3.2.2. Design Considerations

###### Aspect: How much navigability the Select function should have
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The user must always select the notebook title if he wants to choose a section or page within it.
    - Pros: It is easy to catch exceptions when the notebook/section does not exist. This also ensures that even if there are 2 sections in 2 different notebooks with the same name, the user can select the correct section.
    - Cons: The format for the command is longer.
- **Alternative 2**: The user can select a notebook/section/page wherever he wants.
    - Pros: The command the user has to type is much shorter.
    - Cons: If the user has notebooks/sections with the same name, he cannot be sure that the item he wants will be selected correctly.

#### 4.3.3. Tag Feature

The user can add a `tag` to a `Notebook`, `Section` or `Page`. This section describes the implementation and design
considerations for this feature.

##### 4.3.3.1. Implementation
The `Notebook`, `Section` and `Page` classes each contain a member `tag` of type String.

The figure below shows how the tag operation works:

![Sequence Diagram for Tag Notebook command](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_TagNotebook.jpg)

There are 3 crucial processes during the tag operation. When the user enters `tag /tCS2113T` into the command window while using the application:

**Input Parsing**
1. `CliUserInterface` receives the "tag /tCS2113T" input by the user and calls the `executeCommand` method.
2. Method `executeCommand` constructs the `InputParser` class and calls `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` to pass the
input to `InputParser`.
3. `InputParser#getCommandFromInput`calls `InputParser#parseTagDescription` to separate the index from the tag.
4. If the application is in the notebook mode, `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` constructs the
`TagCommandTimetableMode` class. Note that `AppState#getCurrentNotebook`, `AppState#getCurrentSection` and
`AppState#getCurrentPage` are called to determine the state of the application.
5. `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` returns `TagCommandNotebookMode` back to `CliUserInterface`.

**Command Execution**
1. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` calls `TagCommandNotebookMode#execute` to execute the command.
2. `TagCommandNotebookMode#execute()` first constructs the `CliMessages` class, which prints any outputs to the user.
3. `AppState#getAppMode` returns where the user is.
3. If the user is in a `Notebook`, `Section` or `Page`, `Notebook#setTag`, `Section#setTag` or `Page#setTag` is called
respectively to change the tag of the current notebook.
4. If the tag is successful, `CliMessages#printTagNotebookMessage` displays the message to the user.

**Storage**
1. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` finally calls `TagCommandNotebookMode#isTriggerAutoSave` method to check whether a
change has been made.
2. If the method returns `True`, `CliUserInterface#executeCommand`calls `saveState` method to save the
current list.
3. The tag operation ends.

##### 4.3.3.2. Design Considerations
This section describes some of the considerations involved when designing the tag feature.

###### Aspect: How to store the tags
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store as a private `String` member in every task
    - Pros: It is easy to access for print operations.
    - Cons: It is unoptimized in terms of complexity for search operations, which requires more work for scaling of the
    application.
- **Alternative 2:** Store as a Hash Table with the key as the tag and value as `Task`
    - Pros: It has a better time complexity for search operations since this data structure is more optimized (O(1) can
    be achieved).
    - Cons: It is hard to retrieve the tag for a specific `Task` due to the structure of the key-value pair.

#### 4.3.4. Search Feature

This feature works similarly to the [search feature](#425-search-feature) in the Timetable mode. Refer to
[Tag Feature](#433-tag-feature) for more information on the implementation of tags in the Notebook mode.

##### 4.3.4.1. Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the search feature works in the notebook mode:

![Sequence Diagram for Find Notebook Command](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_FindNotebook.jpg)

As the implementation of the search feature in the Notebook mode is similar to that in the Timetable mode, this section
only covers the main differences in the two.

**Input Parsing**
- If the application is in the Notebook mode, `InputParser#getCommandFromInput` constructs the `FindCommandNotebookMode`
class.

###### Aspect: How much navigability the Select function should have
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The user must always select the notebook title if he wants to choose a section or page within it.
    - Pros: It is easy to catch exceptions when the notebook/section does not exist. This also ensures that even if there are 2 sections in 2 different notebooks with the same name, the user can select the correct section.
    - Cons: The format for the command is longer.
- **Alternative 2**: The user can select a notebook/section/page wherever he wants.
    - Pros: The command the user has to type is much shorter.
    - Cons: If the user has notebooks/sections with the same name, he cannot be sure that the item he wants will be selected correctly.

**Command Execution**
Method `FindCommandNotebookMode#execute()` does the following:<br>
a. Constructs `CliMessages` class, which prints any outputs to the user<br>
b. If `keyword` is specified (not empty), `getAllWithTitleContainingKeyword()` is called.
`getAllWithTitleContainingKeyword()`searches for all notebooks, sections and pages that have titles that contain the
keyword. <br>
c. Else, if the `tag` is specified (not empty), `getAllWithTagsContainingKeyword` is called. This method finds
all notebooks, sections and pages that have tags that fit `tag`.<br>
d. The messages to output to the user are added to `ArrayList`s.
e. Calls `CliMessages#printFoundNotebooksMessages`, `CliMessages#printFoundSectionsMessages` and
`CliMessages#printFoundPagesMessages` are called if `Notebook`s, `Section`s and `Page`s are found respectively. These
methods output the titles of the found notebooks, sections and pages to the user.

##### 4.3.4.2. Design Considerations

Aspect: Way to search through the notebook shelf
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Loop through every page, section and notebook
    - Pros: Able to trace the notebook and section that a found page belongs to. This makes it more convenient to show
    to the user.
    - Cons: It is unoptimized in terms of complexity, with a complexity of O(n<sup>3</sup>).
- **Alternative 2:** Store all notebooks, sections and pages into respective lists
    - Pros: Has better time complexity of O(n) as it only needs to iterate through each list.
    - Cons: Unable to output the notebook and section a page belongs to to the user

#### 4.3.5. List Feature

##### 4.3.5.1. Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation in the notebook mode works:

![Sequence Diagram for List](diagrams/class/jpeg/SequenceDiagram_ListSection.jpg)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list function behaves.

Step 1. The user types `list /s`. The `list /s` command is passed through
`InputParser#getCommandFromInput`, which constructs a `ListCommandNoteMode` object and calls
`ListCommandNotebookMode#execute()`.

Step 2. `execute()` is called, which then calls the print functions based on the `AppMode` field in `AppState`.

Step 3. The program prints the contents corresponding to the input or throw an exception if the command is
invalid.

##### 4.3.5.2. Design Considerations

### 4.4. Storage (Neil)

The `Storage` class reads and writes the application state to and from a text file.

#### 4.4.1. Storage format

This section describes the format used to store the TaskList and NotebookShelf from the application state in a plain
text file.

:exclamation: The operating system newline character is used to terminate lines; that is, `\r\n` on Windows and
`\n` on UNIX-based systems.

##### 4.4.1.1. TaskList

For `TaskList`, the format is as follows:

* One line containing an integer `n`, the number of tasks.
* `3n` lines follow, every 3 lines describing one task.
* The first line contains the task title as a String.
* The second line contains the task due date, in the format `dd-MM-yyyy hhmm`.
* The third line contains a value `true` or `false`, indicating whether the task is done. (`true` means done,
`false` means not done.)

##### 4.4.1.2. Page

For a single page, the format is as follows:

* One line containing the title of the page.
* One line containing the content of the page. Newline characters in the content are replaced with the string `"~~~"`.

##### 4.4.1.3. Section

For a single section, the format is as follows:

* One line containing an integer `p`, the number of pages in the section.
* `p` pages are then described, as specified [here](#4412-page).

##### 4.4.1.4. Notebook

For a single notebook, the format is as follows:

* One line containing an integer `s`, the number of sections.
* `s` sections are then described, as specified [here](#4413-section)

##### 4.4.1.5. NotebookShelf

For `NotebookShelf`, the format is as follows:

* One line containing an integer `n`, the number of notebooks.
* `n` notebooks are then described, as specified [here](#4414-notebook).

#### 4.4.2 Implementation

`TaskList`, `Task`,`NotebookShelf`, `Notebook`, `Section`, and `page` contain methods called `serialize()`.
These methods return`String` representations of themselves, as specified [here](#441-storage-format).  

The `serialize()` method in `TaskList` calls the `serialize()` methods for every `Task` object within
it and combines their outputs with a `StringBuilder`.

The `serialize()` method in `NotebookShelf` calls the `serialize()` methods for every `Notebook` object within it and
combines their outputs with a `StringBuilder`.

The `serialize()` method in `Notebook` calls the `serialize()` methods for every `Section` object within
it and combines their outputs with a `StringBuilder`.

The `serialize()` method in `Section` calls the `serialize()` methods for every `Page` object within it and
combines their outputs with a `StringBuilder`.

##### 4.4.2.1. Saving the application state

The following sequence diagram describes the operation of the `saveToFile()` operation.

![Sequence Diagram for saveToFile command](diagrams/class/jpeg/storage_neil.jpg)

Note: The diagram above does not show how the `saveToFile()` method saves `Task` objects from the `TaskList`, in
the interest of brevity. The operation of the method is very similar for the `TaskList`, except the hierarchy is much
simpler for tasks (since `Task` objects do not contain other objects).  

The `Storage.saveToFile()` method saves the current application state to a file.

It gets the NotebookShelf and TaskList objects from the current appState, passed in as a parameter. Then, as
described above in the sequence diagram, it iterates through the lists of `Task` objects in the `TaskList` and
`Notebook` objects in the `NotebookShelf`, calling their `serialize()` methods, which in turn call the
`serialize()` methods for each of their contained objects (if applicable). The `saveToFile()` method then uses
`FileWriter`s to write to `File` objects, saving the serialized version of the application state to two text files.

##### 4.4.2.2. Reading the application state

The following sequence diagram describes the operation of the `readFromFile()` operation.

// TODO: Add a sequence diagram to this section.

Note: As above, the diagram omits the reading of the `TaskList` from the text file in the interest of brevity. Again,
this operation is similar to that for `NotebookShelf` but much simpler.

The `Storage.readFromFile()` method creates an instance of `AppState` based on the contents of the saved text files, and
returns said instance of `AppState` if reading the save files was successful, and a blank instance otherwise.

`readFromFile()` uses `Scanner`s, and the `Scanner.nextLine()` method to read the text files line by line. It parses
the lines containing integers indicating the number of notebooks/sections/pages/tasks, and subsequently uses `for`
loops to read the appropriate number of lines.

Each iteration of the loop creates a new instance of `Task`/`Notebook`/`Section`/`Page` as appropriate, using the
constructor to set the fields appropriately based on what is read from the save file, and then it adds the objects
to the appropriate container (i.e. adds each `Task` to the `TaskList`, adds each `Page` to its respective `Section`
etc. ). It then stores the loaded `TaskList` and `NotebookShelf` to a new instance of `AppState` and returns this.

<br>

### 4.5 Error Handling

The `ZeroNoteException` class extends `Exception` by printing an error message to the user when the user encounters an exception.

The following example is a scenario that demonstrates how exceptions are handled in **Zer0Note**.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. `CliUserInterface#executeCommand` is called when the user types in `hello`.

2. The `hello` command is passed through a switch-case block within `InputParser#getCommandFromInput`.

3. As `hello` is not a command in `Zer0Note`, `InvalidCommandException` which extends `ZeroNoteException` will be thrown.

4. This `ZeroNoteException` is caught by `CliUserInterface#run`, which will then call `ZeroNoteException#printErrorMessage`.

<br>

## 5. Documentation

The following section describes how documentation for the project should be written. Note: documentation is all
 written in [GitHub-Flavoured Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

### 5.1. Setting up and maintaining the project website.
- We use **Jekyll** to manage documentation.
- The `docs/` folder is used for documentation.
- To learn how to set it up and maintain the project website, follow the guide
[[se-edu/guides] Using Jekyll for project documentation](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/jekyll.html).

### 5.2. Style guidance
- Follow the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style).
- Also relevant is the [[se-edu/guides] Markdown coding standard](https://se-education.org/guides/conventions/markdown.html).

### 5.3. Diagrams

We use Microsoft Visio Professional 2019 to draw our UML diagrams. If you do not have access to this software, free
alternatives such as [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/), [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings),
[LibreOffice Draw](https://www.libreoffice.org/discover/draw/) and many others are also available. If you wish to
contribute diagrams (which we recommend you do if you contribute new features!), you may use any software of your
choosing to draw the diagrams, as long as the finished product somewhat resembles those we already have and follows
UML syntax strictly.

### 5.4. Converting a document to the PDF Format

We use **Chrome** for converting documentation to PDF format.
> Reason: Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in Web pages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.
1. Go to your generated documentation site on GitHub using Chrome.
2. Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome’s menu.
3. Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format.
For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

## 6. Testing

The following section describes the testing methodologies followed in this project to ensure high-quality, bug-free
code as far as possible.

### 6.1. Running tests

There are two ways to run tests.
- **Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner**
    - To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` and choose `Run 'Tests in tp.test'`
    - To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`.
- **Method 2: Using Gradle**
    - Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

### 6.2. Types of tests
