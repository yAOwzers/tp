# Lusi Wu Qi - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
This project portfolio page aims to record my contributions to the Zer0Note project.

**Zer0Note** is a note taking and organisation application meant for students(especially those who can type fast).
We aim to help our target users integrate and speed up the notetaking and scheduling processes.

**Zer0Note** consists of two modes: Timetable and Notebook. The Timetable mode manages the tasks input by the user while
the Notebook mode manages the user's notes.

### Summary of Contribution

This section describes the contributions I made over the project term.

#### Code contributed

All my work can be viewed [here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=lusi711&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-09-27&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other).

#### Enhancements implemented

- **Major enhancement**: Implemented a **Find** feature for both the Timetable and Notebook modes.
    - What it does: This feature allows the user to find tasks, and notebooks, sections and pages, from the respective
    modes in two ways. The user can search for all titles that contain a keyword, or search for all that have a specified 
    tag (Refer below).
    -Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as:
        - The feature efficiently saves time in terms of searching tasks and notes manually.
        - The feature allows the user to revise previous tasks and notes.
    - Highlights: This enhancement handles finding by keyword and tag within a single class `FindCommand`.
- **Minor enhancement**: Implemented a **Tag** feature for both the Timetable and Notebook modes.
    - What it does: This feature allows the user to add a tag to tasks, and notebooks, sections and pages, in the
    Timetable and Notebook mode respectively.
    -Justification: This feature is important because it allows the user to group multiple tasks, notebooks, sections 
    and pages into a single category without having the same 
    keyword in the title.
- **Minor enhancement**: Implemented a **Delete** feature for both the Timetable and Notebook modes.
    - What it does: This feature allows the user to remove an existing task in Timetable mode, and an existing notebook, 
    section or page, in the Notebook mode.
    - Justification: We thought this is a crucial feature for users to change wrongly written tasks and notes, or
     remove unwanted contents.
