### Summary of Contributions
- Created ASCII art for Zer0Note
- New Feature: Added the ability to add tasks and notebooks/sections/pages
  - What it does: It allows the user to add tasks in Timetable mode and add notebooks/sections/pages in Notebook mode.
  - Justification: This feature is essential for the purpose of our application, which is to keep track of deadlines and organise notes.
  - Highlights: Since it is the building block for other the features, it required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
- New Feature: Added the ability to select a notebook/section/page
  - Justification: This feature makes Notebook mode more interactive for the user. It allows the user to navigate between notebooks, sections and pages, just like he would if he had many physical notebooks.
