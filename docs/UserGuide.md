## Introduction

Zer0Note is a note taking and organisation application that combines the ease of use and feature set of graphical tools with the interaction speed of command-line based tools like vim and emacs.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
1. Download the latest version of `Zer0Note` from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2113T-T12-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for Zer0Note.
4. Double click the file to start the app.
5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.

## Features

>:exclamation: Notes about the format:
* Words within `[square brackets]` are the expected user inputs.
  e.g. in `add /n[NOTEBOOK]`, `NOTEBOOK` is a parameter which can be used as `add /nCS2101`
* Words within `(parentheses)` are optional user input.
  e.g. in `list (/urgent)`, `/urgent` is an optional parameter.
* Within a code segment, `>>>` denotes the command typed by the user.

 Example:  
  ```
  >>> select /sChapter 1
        now in notebook section: Chapter 1
  ```

> `select /sChapter 1` is the user's input, and `now in notebook section: Chapter 1` is the output message.
